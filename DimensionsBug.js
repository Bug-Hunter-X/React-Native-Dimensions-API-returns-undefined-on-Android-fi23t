This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, particularly on Android devices.  The issue is that the dimensions may not be immediately available when the component mounts, resulting in `undefined` values for width and height.  This can cause crashes or unexpected behavior if you try to use these values before they are populated.

```javascript
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

// ... later in the component ...
<View style={{ width: width, height: height }} />
```

In this example, if `Dimensions.get('window')` returns `undefined` the View component will fail to render correctly.
